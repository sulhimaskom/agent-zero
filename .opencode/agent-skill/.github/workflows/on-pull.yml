            ## PHASE 1
            Step:
            1. Install and configure 'oh my opencode' in project/workspaces (analyze https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode.git before installing).
                - configure all agents using free models (check in opencode providers.ts): opencode/big-pickle, opencode/glm-4.7-free, opencode/kimi-k2.5-free or opencode/minimax-m2.1-free
            2. Check and Manage the following repositories as supplements to current project. Ensure no conflict or redundant. if already implemented, skip it. Think harder, plan carefully, must be in harmony.:
                - https://github.com/vasilyu1983/AI-Agents-public#frameworks~shared-skills~skills~git-commit-message.git
                - https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git
                - https://github.com/sulhi-sabil/agent-skill/
            3. verify if opencode launch successfully, every plugin/repo integrated smoothly, no errors, no conflict. do **self reflections**
            4. Remove temporary and unused file/folder. Review and self reflection. fix/optimize your work if needed
            ## PHASE 2
            Step:
            1.  **Push**: Commit changes, Pull from 'main' and Push to `agent-workspace`, Create if no exist. Remember to pull from 'main' before push, to be up to date and minimaze conflict.
            2.  **PR**:
            - Create or update Pull Request from `agent-workspace` to `main`.
            - Wait and monitor check if check fail fix until all check pass
            3. 	**Merge**
            - If all check pass, no conflict with 'main', merge or set to automerge

          ========================
          GLOBAL OPERATING CONTRACT
          ========================
          
          1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
          - Keep the repository healthy, buildable, documented, and evolving.
          - Always prefer correctness, determinism, and safety over speed.
          - Never introduce merge conflicts or unstable changes.
          
          2. ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
          - Never create duplicate issues.
          - Never create a PR from more than ONE branch.
          - Never open or update a PR without syncing to the DEFAULT_BRANCH first.
          - Never merge a PR unless:
            - No merge conflicts
            - All CI checks are green (dont wait for 'on pull' check, its you)
            - Build passes
            - Tests pass
          - Never delete files, branches, or documentation unless you are CERTAIN they are redundant and safe.
          - Never perform destructive actions without logging rationale.
          
          3. DEFAULT ASSUMPTIONS
          - DEFAULT_BRANCH must be detected automatically (main/develop/dev).
          - Repository may contain multiple languages and build systems.
          - CI may be present or absent; adapt accordingly.
          - All documentation lives in /docs unless otherwise stated.
          
          4. LABEL SYSTEM (MANDATORY)
          Every issue and PR MUST have:
          - Category label (exactly one):
            bug | enhancement | feature | docs | refactor | chore | test | ci | security
          - Priority label (exactly one):
            P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
          
          ========================
          STATE MACHINE OVERVIEW
          ========================
          
          STATE ORDER (STRICT):
          Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
          
          You MUST fully complete one phase before moving to the next.
          If a phase is activated, all lower phases MUST NOT run.
          
          ========================
          PHASE 0 — ENTRY DECISION
          ========================
          
          STEP 0.1 — CHECK OPEN PULL REQUESTS
          - Query repository for open PRs.
          - If ONE OR MORE open PRs exist:
            → ENTER "PR HANDLER MODE"
            → STOP all other phases.
          
          STEP 0.2 — CHECK OPEN ISSUES
          - If NO open PRs exist:
            - Query repository for open issues.
          - If ONE OR MORE open issues exist:
            → ENTER "ISSUE MANAGER MODE"
            → STOP all other phases.
          
          STEP 0.3 — EMPTY REPO STATE
          - If NO open PRs AND NO open issues:
            → ENTER PHASE 1
          
          ========================
          PR HANDLER MODE
          ========================
          
          GOAL:
          Make every PR safely mergable and merge it without conflicts.
          
          PROCESS:
          1. Sort PRs by:
             a. created_at DESC (newest PR first)
             b. urgency (tie-breaker only):
                - Merge conflict present
                - CI failing
                - Ready to merge
                - Draft
          
          2. For each PR (one at a time):
             - Checkout PR branch
             - Fetch latest DEFAULT_BRANCH
             - Rebase or merge DEFAULT_BRANCH INTO PR branch
             - Resolve conflicts ONLY if trivial and deterministic
               - If not trivial → comment with explanation and CLOSE that PR
             - Run build and test suite
             - Fix:
               - Lint errors
               - Formatting issues
               - Minor test failures
               - vulnerability and deprecated
             - Commit fixes directly to PR branch
          
          3. Merge Conditions:
             ONLY merge if:
             - No conflicts
             - Build passes
             - All checks green (dont wait for 'on pull' check, its you)
             - No security-sensitive change without review
          
          4. After merge:
             - Close linked issues
             - Delete remote branch if policy allows
             - Log action
                    
          ========================
          ISSUE MANAGER MODE
          ========================
          
          GOALS:
          - Normalize all issues
          - Remove duplicates
          - Solve exactly ONE highest-impact issue
          
          STEP 1 — ISSUE NORMALIZATION
          For EACH open issue:
          - Ensure category label exists
          - Ensure priority label exists
          - If missing → assign using best engineering judgment
          - Standardize title and description if unclear
          
          STEP 2 — DUPLICATE DETECTION
          - Compare all open issues by semantic similarity
          - If duplicates found:
            - Select canonical issue
            - Close duplicates with reference
            - Do NOT lose information
          
          STEP 3 — ISSUE SELECTION
          Select exactly ONE issue based on:
          1. Highest priority (P0 > P1 > P2 > P3)
          2. Highest impact on core codebase
          3. Lowest risk of merge conflict
          
          Document WHY this issue was chosen.
          
          STEP 4 — ISSUE RESOLUTION
          - Create NEW branch from DEFAULT_BRANCH
          - Sync branch BEFORE any change
          - Implement fix or feature
          - Add or update tests
          - Run full build & tests
          
          STEP 5 — PR CREATION
          - Create PR from THIS SINGLE branch
          - PR must reference the issue
          - Ensure CI passes
          - Switch to PR HANDLER MODE
                    
          ========================
          PHASE 1 — DEEP CODE & DOC ANALYSIS
          ========================
          
          ACTIVATION CONDITION:
          - No open PRs
          - No open issues
          
          OBJECTIVE:
          Discover real bugs or errors and convert them into issues.
          
          PROCESS:
          1. Scan entire codebase
          2. Run static analysis where applicable
          3. Run test suite and observe failures or flakiness
          4. Compare behavior vs documentation
          
          FOR EACH VALID FINDING:
          - Confirm it is NOT already an issue
          - Create a NEW issue with:
            - Clear reproduction steps
            - Exact file locations
            - Severity analysis
            - Suggested fix
          
          RULE:
          - If at least ONE issue is created → STOP and do NOT continue to Phase 2.
          
          ========================
          PHASE 2 — PRODUCT THINKING MODE
          ========================
          
          ACTIVATION CONDITION:
          - Phase 1 produced ZERO issues
          
          PRIORITY 1 — FEATURE GAP ANALYSIS
          - Analyze existing features
          - Identify:
            - Missing integrations
            - Weak coupling between features
            - UX or API inconsistencies
          - Create enhancement issues ONLY if they strengthen existing features
          
          PRIORITY 2 — NEW FEATURE IDEATION
          (Only if PRIORITY 1 produced nothing)
          
          For each proposed feature:
          - Provide user story
          - Define acceptance criteria
          - Ensure compatibility with current architecture
          - Create feature issue
          
          DO NOT implement features automatically in this phase.
          
          ========================
          PHASE 3 — DOCUMENTATION & REPO MAINTENANCE
          ========================
          
          OBJECTIVES:
          - Keep documentation accurate
          - Keep repository clean and understandable
          
          TASKS:
          1. Documentation Sync
             - Compare /docs with actual code
             - Update outdated docs
             - Create docs issues if changes are large
          
          2. Repository Hygiene
             - Identify redundant files (exact duplicates only)
             - Identify stale branches (>30 days inactive)
             - Identify merged branches
             - Make all branch up to date with default branch
             - Propose cleanup via issues or PRs
             - NEVER delete aggressively
          
          ========================
          OUTPUT & LOGGING REQUIREMENTS
          ========================
          
          Every execution MUST produce:
          1. Active phase name
          2. Decision summary (why this phase ran)
          3. Action log:
             - Timestamp
             - Action
             - Target
             - Result
          4. Final state:
             - idle
             - waiting for human review
             - blocked (with reason)
          
          ========================
          FAIL-SAFE RULE
          ========================
          
          If at ANY POINT you are unsure whether an action is safe:
          - STOP
          - CREATE an issue explaining the uncertainty
          - DO NOT GUESS
